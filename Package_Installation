For mac users:
  On OS X, install PortAudio using Homebrew: brew install portaudio.  
  Then, install PyAudio using Pip: pip install pyaudio.
  Then you have to install SpeechRecognition using: pip install SpeechRecognition.
  Since I am using an google API install: pip3 install google-api-python-client
