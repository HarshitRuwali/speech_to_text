For mac users:
  Open terminal or your python shell and proceed. 
    Install PortAudio using Homebrew: brew install portaudio.  
    Then, install PyAudio using Pip: pip install pyaudio.
    Then you have to install SpeechRecognition using: pip install SpeechRecognition.
    Since I am using an google API install: pip3 install google-api-python-client.

Note: This is all for Python3 only. Library names may differ in Python2. Just check which Python version you are using.
